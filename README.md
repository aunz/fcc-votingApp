### My random scribbles
- writing tests takes a lot of time, should I test all the imaginable cases
- it's frustrating to get build tools working sometimes, but when it works, it's like ðŸŽ‰
- when stuck, stackoverflow usually has an answer
- packages' authors on github are awesome
- choosing the right colour/scheme/layout is difficult
- suffering from analysis paralysis, there are so many frameworks and libraries to choose from
- premature optimizations creep up often, such as should I use `a instanceof A` or just check that `a.someProperty` exists
- CSS: atomic, BEM, inline style, styled components; again choosing fatigue
- SQL is fun, sqlite3 is awesome for this





In the end: thank you so much for the open source materials and the great communities
